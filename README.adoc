This repository is a lab for experimenting with Ruby-based Asciidoctor extensions using the Extensions API.
*Please do not use this code in production.*
The code is untested.
It is also not packaged and distributed.
The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate how extensions are set up, how to write them, and what they can do.
The examples also offer patterns that can be reused when implementing your own extension.

In order to use the extensions in this repository, you need to clone the repository.
Then, you need to pass the location of the extension you want to use to Asciidoctor using the `-r` CLI option or require it in your Ruby script if you are using the Asciidoctor API.

If you only want to test the extensions in this repository, skip ahead to <<using-an-extension>>.

If you want to use one of the extensions from this lab in production, and perhaps develop it further, please import it into a new project and distribute it as a RubyGem.
If you're prepared to maintain it for the community, you can submit a request in the https://asciidoctor.zulipchat.com[project chat] to graduate it a top-level project in the Asciidoctor organization.
When writing your own extension, we recommend that you study the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/extensions/[extensions section] in the Asciidoctor documentation.

== Extension types

We have the following types of extensions in the lab:

* *Preprocessor* - processes the AsciiDoc source before it is parsed
* *IncludeProcessor* - intercepts the AsciiDoc include directive
* *TreeProcessor* - processes the AsciiDoc document (AST) after block-level parsing is complete
* *Postprocessor* - processes the converted output before it is written to the output stream (or disk)
* *DocinfoProcessor* - contributes additional content to the header or footer of the output document
* *BlockProcessor* - adds a custom delimited block
* *BlockMacroProcessor* - adds a custom block macro
* *InlineMacroProcessor* - adds a custom inline macro

The type of extension (e.g, `-block-macro`) is always used in the name of the extension registration file and directory to make it easy to distinguish.
You can also look for examples using `git grep`.
For example, to look for a `BlockMacroProcessor`, run the following command:

 $ git grep BlockMacroProcessor lib/

You'll get a result like this:

....
lib/gist-block-macro/extension.rb:class GistBlockMacro < Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
lib/pass-block-macro/extension.rb:class PassBlockMacro < Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
lib/tree-block-macro/extension.rb:class TreeBlockMacro < Asciidoctor::Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
....

== Extension files

Each extension consists of several files:

* A file that registers the extension (sometimes also contains the extension)
* A file with the extension itself (when not defined in the registration file)
* A file with sample AsciiDoc source to use to test the extension
* Auxiliary assets needed by the extension

For example, the emoji-inline-macro extension has four files:

* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb[lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb] (registration file)
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro/extension.rb[lib/emoji-inline-macro/extension.rb] (extension file)
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc[lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc] (sample AsciiDoc file)
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro/twemoji-awesome.css[lib/emoji-inline-macro/twemoji-awesome.css] (auxiliary asset file)

NOTE: The registration file (e.g., emoji-inline-macro.rb) goes in the [path]_lib_ directory whereas the remaining files go inside a directory whose base name matches the name of the registration file (e.g., emoji-inline-macro).

== Using an extension

Before creating your own extensions, it would be wise to run one yourself.
First, make sure Asciidoctor is installed:

 $ gem install asciidoctor

Next, run the extension from the root directory of the project:

 $ asciidoctor -r lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc
 # asciidoctor: FAILED: 'lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb' could not be loaded
 # Use --trace for backtrace

Oops!
We forgot to include the leading `./` when using the `-r` flag
Let's try again:

 $ asciidoctor -r ./lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc

All right, it ran!
The output file, [path]_sample.html_, was created in the same directory as the source file, [path]_sample.adoc_.

The relevant bits of the input and output are shown below.

._lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc_
[,asciidoc]
----
Faster than a emoji:turtle[1x]!

This is an example of how you can emoji:heart[lg] Asciidoctor and Twitter Emoji.
----

._lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.html_
[,html]
----
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faster than a <i class="twa twa-1x twa-turtle"></i>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of how you can <i class="twa twa-lg twa-heart"></i> Asciidoctor and Twitter Emoji.</p>
</div>
----

WARNING: Certain extensions require additional libraries.
Please consult the extension's registration file for details about what is required to use it.

== Adding an extension

You can find examples of various ways to define an extension in the link:lib/shout-block.rb[] extension.

=== Shorthand (DSL)

If you're creating a trivial extension, you can define the extension using the extension DSL directly in the registration file.
Create a new file in the [path]_lib_ directory.
Include the extension type in the name of the file so others are clear what type of extension it is.

._lib/sample-block.rb_
[,ruby]
----
Asciidoctor::Extensions.register do
  block do
    named :sample
    on_context :open

    process do |parent, reader, attrs|
      create_paragraph parent, reader.lines, attrs
    end
  end
end
----

=== Formal

If you're creating a more complex extension or want to enable reuse, you're encouraged to move the extension code to the [path]_extension.rb_ inside a directory with the same base name as the registration file.
In the case of a block, block macro or inline macro, this enables you to register the extension multiple times.

._lib/sample-block.rb_
[,ruby]
----
RUBY_ENGINE == 'opal' ? (require 'sample-block/extension') : (require_relative 'sample-block/extension')

Asciidoctor::Extensions.register do
  block SampleBlock
end
----

._lib/sample-block/extension.rb_
[,ruby]
----
class SampleBlock < Asciidoctor::Extensions::BlockProcessor
  use_dsl
  named :sample
  on_context :open

  def process parent, reader, attrs
    create_paragraph parent, reader.lines, attrs
  end
end
----

It's customary to provide a sample AsciiDoc file named [path]_sample.adoc_ inside the extension subdirectory that others can use to try the extension.
You should also add your extension to the <<extension-catalog>> section along with a short description of what it does.
