= Asciidoctor Extensions Lab
:idprefix:

:toc: preamble

A repository of sample and incubating Ruby-based extensions for Asciidoctor.

If you just want to use the extensions here, skip ahead to <<using-an-extension>>.
To create your own extension, we recommend that you first read the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#extensions[extensions section] in the Asciidoctor user manual.

== Extension types

We have these types of extensions in the lab:

- *Preprocessor* - processes the AsciiDoc source before it is parsed
- *IncludeProcessor* - intercepts the AsciiDoc include directive
- *Treeprocessor* - processes the parsed AsciiDoc document (AST)
- *Postprocessor* - processes the converted output before it is written to the output stream (or disk)
- *BlockProcessor* - adds a custom delimited block
- *BlockMacroProcessor* - adds a custom block macro
- *InlineMacroProcessor* - adds a custom inline macro

The type of extension (e.g, `-block-macro`) is always used in the name of the extension load file and directory to make it easy to distinguish.
You can also look for examples using `git grep`.
For example, to look for a `BlockMacroProcessor`, run the following command:

  $ git grep BlockMacroProcessor lib/

You will get a result like this:

....
lib/chart-block-macro/extension.rb:class ChartBlockMacro < Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
lib/gist-block-macro/extension.rb:class GistBlockMacro < Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
lib/pass-block-macro/extension.rb:class PassBlockMacro < Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
lib/tree-block-macro/extension.rb:class TreeBlockMacro < Asciidoctor::Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
....

== Extension files

Each extension consists of several files:

- A file that registers the extension (sometimes also contains the extension)
- A file with the extension itself (when not defined in the registration file)
- A file with sample AsciiDoc source to use to test the section
- Auxiliary assets needed by the extension

For example, the emoji-inline-macro extension has four files:

- https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb[lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb] (registration file)
- https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro/extension.rb[lib/emoji-inline-macro/extension.rb] (extension file)
- https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc[lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc] (sample AsciiDoc file)
- https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-extensions-lab/blob/master/lib/emoji-inline-macro/twemoji-awesome.css[lib/emoji-inline-macro/twemoji-awesome.css] (auxiliary asset file)

NOTE: The registration file (e.g., emoji-inline-macro.rb) goes in the [path]_lib_ directory whereas the remaining files go inside a directory whose base name matches the name of the registration file (e.g., emoji-inline-macro).

== Using an extension

Before create your own extensions, it would be wise to run one yourself.
First, make sure Asciidoctor is installed:

 $ gem install asciidoctor

Next, we'll run an extension from the root directory of the project:

  $ asciidoctor -r lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc
  # asciidoctor: FAILED: 'lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb' could not be loaded
  # Use --trace for backtrace

Oops!
We forgot to include the leading `./` when using the `-r` flag
Let's try again:

  $ asciidoctor -r ./lib/emoji-inline-macro.rb lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc

All right, it ran!
The output file, [path]_sample.html_, was created in the same directory as the source file, [path]_sample.adoc_.

The relevant bits of the input and output are show below.

._lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.adoc_
```asciidoc
Faster than a emoji:turtle[1x]!

This is an example of how you can emoji:heart[lg] Asciidoctor and Twitter Emoji.
```

._lib/emoji-inline-macro/sample.html_
```html
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Faster than a <i class="twa twa-1x twa-turtle"></i>!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an example of how you can <i class="twa twa-lg twa-heart"></i> Asciidoctor and Twitter Emoji.</p>
</div>
```

WARNING: Certain extensions require additional libraries.
Please consult the registration file for the extension for details about what is required to use it.

== Adding an extension

You can find examples of various ways to define an extension in the link:lib/shout-block.rb[] extension.

=== Shorthand (DSL)

If you're creating a trivial extension, you can define the extension using the extension DSL directly in the registration file.
Create a new file in the [path]_lib_ directory.
Include the extension type in the name of the file so others are clear what type of extension it is.

._lib/sample-block.rb_
```ruby
require 'asciidoctor/extensions' unless RUBY_ENGINE == 'opal'

include Asciidoctor

Extensions.register do
  block do
    named :sample
    on_context :open

    process do |parent, reader, attrs|
      create_paragraph parent, reader.lines, attrs
    end
  end
end
```

TIP: The `include Asciidoctor` line allows you to use classes from Asciidoctor without the `Asciidoctor::` prefix.

=== Formal

If you are creating a more complex extension or want to enable reuse, you are encouraged to move the extension code to the [path]_extension.rb_ inside a directory with the same base name as the registration file.
In the case of a block, block macro or inline macro extension, this enables you to register it multiple times.

._lib/sample-block.rb_
```ruby
RUBY_ENGINE == 'opal' ? (require 'sample-block/extension') : (require_relative 'sample-block/extension')

Extensions.register do
  block SampleBlock
end
```

._lib/sample-block/extensions.rb_
```ruby
class SampleBlock < Extensions::BlockProcessor
  use_dsl
  named :sample
  on_context :open

  def process parent, reader, attrs
    create_paragraph parent, reader.lines, attrs
  end
end
```

It's customary to provide a sample AsciiDoc file named [path]_sample.adoc_ inside the extension subdirectory that others can use to test the extension.
You should also add your extension to the <<extension-catalog>> section along with a short description of what it does.
