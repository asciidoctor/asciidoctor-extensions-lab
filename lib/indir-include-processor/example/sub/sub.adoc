= Sub Document

ifndef::indir[:indir: .]

Sub document paragraph.

The variable `indir` has the value `{indir}`.
This variable can be useful for in standalone documents that can also be included into other documents.

image::{indir}/images/example.svg[]

The above image has been included using `image::\{indir\}/images/example.svg[]`.
The `indir` variable that is used in the image path always points to the directory of the current (possibly included) asciidoc file.
As a result, the image path is correct, no matter if `sub.adoc` is compiled standalone or included in `master.adoc`.
