= Doing DocBook-index markup in AsciiDoc

// N-dash:
:N: pass:[&#8211;]
// M-dash:
:M: pass:[&#8212;]


AsciiDoctor is the bee's knees! But let's face it: nobody wants to _overwrite_ their DocBook indexing_note:[DocBook, type= tech]indexing-markup by simply editing their AsciiDoctor manuscript and re-generating DocBook.indexing_note:[AsciiDoctor, tYpE =tech, seealso = AsciiDoc , priMARy_sortas = Asciidoctor, seeALSO20= lightweight markup languages ]
_Heck, no:_ for that would involve the dubious pleasure of _re-doing_ that markup--in DocBook{M}__again and again!__

So then, what you need{M}__really need__{M}my frabjous colleagues, is a way to write all that markup _inside your AsciiDoctor manuscript_.
Well, little buckaroos and buckarinas, this is it!

This extension lets you write--very easily{M}__all__ the kinds of indexing-markup the DocBook Duckindexing_note:[DocBook, the Duck, secoNdAry_sORTas= duck, type= interesting animals] supports.
It doesn't get better than that!

TIP: And why is it worthwhile to do such indexing-markup? Well, that would be because if AsciiDoctor is the bee's knees, well, DocBook is the cat's pajamas! "`DocBook`" in the wider sense, that is--which includes the awesome "`DocBook XSL`", and can do such awesomeness as __generating a full index, from that markup!__footnote:[However, it will not create specialized indices for you, based on `+type+`, unless you pass the XSL stylesheet a 1 (true) value for its `+index.on.type+` parameter.]

So, what are we lookin`' at, with this thing? Well, it amounts to three inline macros and a block macro. For example:

`+indexing_note:[DocBook, the Duck, secoNdAry_sORTas= duck, type= tech]+`

To give you something concrete, here's what that inline-macro notation--crappy capitalization and all--gets converted to:

`+<indexterm type="tech"><primary>DocBook</primary><secondary sortas="duck">the Duck</secondary></indexterm>+`

In fact, that notation is included in a paragraph above (though, if you're using this extension and any but a DocBook backend, it won't appear in the output).indexing_note:[ Gone with the Wind, Abbot & Costello, The King of Siam         , secondary_sORTas = 'Wilma', TYPE = nonsense, primary_SORtas ="Fred",sCoPe= All ,  tertIAry_sORTas = 'Barney', seealso20= 'my jeans',seealso ='your jeans', sigNIFicance = nOrMaL, ] Here's another one that's up there:

`+indexing_note:[AsciiDoctor, tYpE =tech, seealso = AsciiDoc , priMARy_sortas = Asciidoctor, seeALSO20= lightweight markup languages ]+`

which gets turned into

`+<indexterm type="tech"><primary sortas="Asciidoctor">AsciiDoctor</primary><seealso>AsciiDoc</seealso><seealso>lightweight markup languages</seealso></indexterm>+`

A usage-note: in AsciiDoc's attribute-lists, the "positional" attributes are called that _for a reason!_ and they *must* appear *before* the named ones, lest they get renamed--or in any case, referenced--wrongly!

In this macro, the first such attribute's value goes into a `+<primary>+`, the second (if any) into a `+<secondary>+`, and any third into a `+<tertiary>+`.
That's it, that's all the index-levels you get in DocBook; and, it's all the positional attributes you get, in any of this extension's three inline macros.
(Any others you insert will quietly be ignored.)

Well, I've shown you just the `+indexing_note+` macro; so, what do the other two inline macros do?
They're for marking the start and the end, respectively, of a "`range`", i.e. a _passage_ to index: e.g.,

====
indexing_start:[ the DocBook Duck, id= the_DocBook_duck, type= interesting animals, primary_sortas= duck]There is really so much to say about ducks. There is the DocBook duck, as a notable case in point. Some have even conjectured that this precocious bird was the inspiration for a certain SSL/TLS expert's publishing company's name. I have not been able to interview him yet, with regard to this intriguing conjecture.

But no one should doubt the tenacity of this creature. There are other interesting critters, of course, such as the awe-inspiring wolpertinger.indexing_note:[wolpertinger, type= interesting animals] Which reminds me of another notable techie I should interview. Ah! There's just so much to learn about interesting animals! But I digress... this is really a passage about the DocBook Duck.indexing_end:[id=the_DocBook_duck]

Here's what the AsciiDoctor looks like:

....
indexing_start:[ the DocBook Duck, id= the_DocBook_duck, type= interesting animals, primary_sortas= duck]There is really so much to say about ducks. There is the DocBook duck, as a notable case in point. Some have even conjectured that this precocious bird was the inspiration for a certain SSL/TLS expert's publishing company's name. I have not been able to interview him yet, with regard to this intriguing conjecture.

But no one should doubt the tenacity of this creature. There are other interesting critters, of course, such as the awe-inspiring wolpertinger.indexing_note:[wolpertinger, type= interesting animals] Which reminds me of another notable techie I should interview. Ah! There's just so much to learn about interesting animals! But I digress... this is really a passage about the DocBook Duck.indexing_end:[id=the_DocBook_duck]
....


The resulting DocBook is:

....
<simpara><indexterm id="the_DocBook_duck" class="startofrange" type="interesting animals"><primary sortas="duck">the DocBook Duck</primary></indexterm>There is really so much to say about ducks. There is the DocBook duck, as a notable case in point. Some have even conjectured that this precocious bird was the inspiration for a certain SSL/TLS expert&#8217;s publishing company&#8217;s name. I have not been able to interview him yet, with regard to this intriguing conjecture.</simpara>
<simpara>But no one should doubt the tenacity of this creature. There are other interesting critters, of course, such as the awe-inspiring wolpertinger.<indexterm type="interesting animals"><primary>wolpertinger</primary></indexterm> Which reminds me of another notable techie I should interview.

But I digress&#8230;&#8203; this is really a passage about the DocBook Duck.<indexterm startref="the_DocBook_duck" class="endofrange" /></simpara>
....

N.B.: The `+indexing_end+` macro-notation should specify one thing only--the ID of the `+indexing_start+` notation that marks the start of the passage being indexed.
These ID values must match exactly, _including case,_ and must satisfy https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-Name[XML's rules for "`NT-Name`" values].



By the way, here's an artificial, "`everything but the kitchen sink`" sort of entry I placed inside a paragraph above--just to illustrate some other attributes available:

`+indexing_note:[ Gone with the Wind, Abbot & Costello, The King of Siam         , secondary_sORTas = 'Wilma', TYPE = nonsense, primary_SORtas ="Fred",sCoPe= All ,  tertIAry_sORTas = 'Barney', seealso20= 'my jeans',seealso ='your jeans', sigNIFicance = nOrMaL, ]+`

The DocBook it converts to is:

`+<indexterm type="nonsense" significance="normal" scope="all"><primary sortas="Fred">Gone with the Wind</primary><secondary sortas="Wilma">Abbot &amp; Costello</secondary><tertiary sortas="Barney">The King of Siam</tertiary><seealso>my jeans</seealso><seealso>your jeans</seealso></indexterm>+`

You'll have noticed that a few of our '`seealso`'-named attributes had numeric characters at the end: e.g., `+seealso20+`.
That's because in AsciiDoctor attribute-lists, _you cannot have two named attributes with the same name._
If you do, AsciiDoctor uses only the last value with that name.

To "`unique-ify`" their attribute names within the same macro-notation instance, add a unique numerical sequence (any length) to the end of each--or, to all but one--of the `+seealso+` attributes. In this way, your `+seealso+` values will all pass through into `+<seealso>+` elements--as in the above examples.

Another attribute you can have which creates an element in DocBook, is `+see+`.
For its meaning, and that of the DocBook attributes `+type+`, `+significance+`, `+scope+`, and `+pagenum+` (all of which you can use in your list), please see the excellent DocBook text by Norman Walsh--most versions of which you can find online. (Bob Stayton's book _DocBook XSL_, now in its 4th ed., is also invaluable.)
I will warn you, though, that if you include a `+see+` in the same indexing-markup notation where you have a `+seealso+`-type attribute, the DocBook schema will complain.footnote:[Although your _capitalization_ of the attribute-names is irrelevant, your _spelling_ them correctly is crucial. Likewise, using (and spelling correctly) any of the enumerated proper values for `+scope+` and `+significance+` is crucial. Any misspellings cause your attribute to be ignored.]footnote:[Also: if you include a `+tertiary_sortas+` attribute, but forget to include an actual tertiary positional-attribute _value_, then no `+<tertiary>+` element at all will appear in the output. The same is true of `+<secondary>+`--but NOT of `+<primary>+`, though only the bare `+<primary>+` element will appear (with no attribute).]

Now, I omitted one other attribute which, in our macros, you can use only in `+indexing_note+`: that attribute is `+zone+`.
It contains a single-space-character-separated list of XML ID-values (see above) that are each an anchor (ID) of sections or paragraphs within your AsciiDoctor manuscript (see the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[AsciiDoctor User Manual], sections 16.2; 27.1{N}2).

When it includes `+zone+`, an `+indexing_note+` indexes, not its own location, but all the sections or paragraphs, in your manuscript, to which its `+zone+` attribute refers!
The location of such an `+indexing_note+` itself is irrelevant to the index.footnote:[Although I've been using it throughout--and I advise you to get very familiar with it--the `+type+` attribute is optional. But any untyped index, if living alongside other, specialized ("`typed`") indices, will suck into its contents every single item that appears in _any_ of those other indices! If that's not what you want your "`General Index`" to do, then one of your index types should simply be "`general`"{M}and you should accordingly "`type`" _every instance_ of indexing-macro you have in your AsciiDoctor.]


All the extension's inline macros should be used _within_ a paragraph. That's important: for a number of reasons, you don't want the `+indexterm+` elements to appear _between_ paragraphs. But we said there's also a block macro in this extension.

Such a macro is to _create_ a block. This particular block macro is not to do indexing-markup: it's to indicate the place you want DocBook XSL to create the actual index, a.k.a. the "`index catalog`":

`+indexcatalog::[Interesting Animals Index, type = "interesting animals"]+`

Note that, since it's a block macro, it needs two colons, `+::+`, instead of just `+:+`.footnote:[Them danged colons are tyrannical, but they must be served! Likewise, remember to use _commas_, not semicolons or something else, to separate attributes in a list. If an attribute's value _contains_ a comma, put single- or double-quotation marks around that whole value.]
That produces this XML:

`+<index type="interesting animals"><title>Interesting Animals Index</title></index>+`


indexcatalog::[ Index to Amazing Technologies, type = tech]

indexcatalog::[Interesting Animals Index, type = interesting animals]
